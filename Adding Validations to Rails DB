Validations enforce constraints on your model so you can have greater control on what you are allowing as data to be saved in your database/tables.
Normally we are able to creat the record of any type but we have to apply condition so that only the record meeting specific criteria are added to DB.

in the model file of the specific table where ther eis a class like 

Class Blogs
# validates "field" , "validate for what?"
validates :title, presence: tr

end

this will make sure that only record with titles are accepted.
