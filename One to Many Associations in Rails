Start with creating a scaffold User with field username type string:
command for it is: 

=> rails generate scaffold User username:string
After you run this command, you will see a migraiton in db> migrate folder, now we need ot run that migration so to run the migration:

=> rails db:migrate

it will create a user table.and you can check in App> models> User.rb file. 
it will be created automatically.



now to check:

rails c

User.all  #because name of User in class user.rb

This will give us a list of all the records. 

For checking purpose, create 2 users by . 
User.create(username: "Usama")
User.create(username: "Bhatti")
