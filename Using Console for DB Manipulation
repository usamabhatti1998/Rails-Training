First of all Opne Rails Console:


=> Rails c


-TO PRINT ALL THE EXISTING RECORDS:

=> className.all

in our Case:
=> Blog.all

This will show following: 
 (1.6ms)  SELECT sqlite_version(*)
  Blog Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "blogs".* FROM "blogs"     
  as it runs a SQL Query
  
  
  
  Create a Record:
  
  Method 1:
  
  ClassName.create(topic:"bla bla bla" , description: "bla bla bla")

In Our Case:
  
Blog.create(topic: "How to Learn Rails" , description: "To Learn Rails, You Hvae to Take U
demy COurses")

NOTE: your field may vary based on the type and anmeof field you have scpecified earlier in the schema  and model file 

ID will be added manually by rails. 



Method 2:
This is hte preffered way fo creating objects. 
in thsi methdo we will use a variable and that varable will be an instance of the DB class, in our case, BLog classs. 

so it will go like:

blog= Blog.new

blog.title = "Sample Title"

blog.description = " Sample Description "

NOTE: These Data is only in the objects, not on db, so if we will print "blog" , it will just show us the value we set so to make sure it gets save to databse and and it shows us the fields that ar eset by rais , then we have to 
=>blog.save 
this command will save the data to DB
