Previosuly we were using only the articles table, now we willitroduce a new table named as user.

User will have 
User ID - Name - Email - Password

How this is gonna be linked to articles table: 

Realtions is: Every article is created by any user so we will change article table to:

ID - Title - Description - User_Id

User_Id => Primary Key in User Table and Foreign Key in Articles Table. 

User Tabel ---- Article Table is one to many relationship because:

User has many articles, one article has only one user.
