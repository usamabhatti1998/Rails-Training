Previosuly we were using only the articles table, now we willitroduce a new table named as user.

User will have 
User ID - Name - Email - Password

How this is gonna be linked to articles table: 

Realtions is: Every article is created by any user so we will change article table to:

ID - Title - Description - User_Id

User_Id => Primary Key in User Table and Foreign Key in Articles Table. 

User Tabel ---- Article Table is one to many relationship because:

User has many articles, one article has only one user. 




Now, 
we have to add user_id colum ot article one as we need 
ID - Title - Description - User_Id
this configuration so we will make changes to existing table,  to make changes , we will create a new migration and in that migration file, we will pass on changes and then run db: migrate to make sur ehcanges take effect on table. 
in simple words, we have to add foreign key to artilces folder. 

command to creat migration:

rails generate migration add_user_id_to_artilces

this will create a migration file under the DB , in that migration file, below the change method, add htis line:
  add_column :articles,  :user_id, :int;     #add column to :articles table and name of colums is :user_id and its type is :integer.
  
  
  after this, run |
  
  rails db:migrate  #to make sure changes take effect. 
  
  to check if changes have taken effect, open rails consile and check 
Articles.all
and you will see an epty user_id field in all. 


make sure you run rials consile again after making changes.
