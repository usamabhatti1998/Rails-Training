App Folder:

Models
Views 
Controllers
All will be lisited here. 


In views, there will be an Apllication.html.erb that ahs both ruby and html in it. <= singn in that field denotes presence of ruby.

Rails Server:

Type =>  rails server OR rails s 

Go the localhost:3000 will be root route of application in development.

Root Route: route where applciation goes by default. Not just in ruby but every application. BASE URL


To Route as per our choice:

We will adjust routes for our applcaition.  
For setting routes, we will go to config files

Main Folder > Config > routes.rb

by default there will be no routes set, so we will set our own. 

FLOW OF A REQUEST:


First of all, a reques tis recieved by routes file. it directs that request to relvant controller and controller sruns the specific function in it. 

for example, we have set the root folder to 
"pages#welcome"

now this will go to controllers, adn find pages controller, inside the pages controller it will find the the function named as one after #. that is welcome in our case.


If localhost:3000 is requested, 
then go to pages controller and inside the pages controller, run the welcome function.
